# Chapter 5: Fundamentals of machine learning

This chapter covers

* Understanding the tension between generalization and optimization,
  the fundamental issue in machine learning
* Evaluation methods for machine learning models
* Best practices to improve model fitting
* Best practices to achieve better generalization

After the three practical examples in chapter 4, you should be starting to feel
familiar with how to approach classification and regression problems using
neural networks, and you’ve witnessed the central problem of machine learning:
overfitting. This chapter will formalize some of your new intuition about
machine learning into a solid conceptual framework, highlighting
the importance of accurate model evaluation and the balance between
training and generalization.

## Generalization: The goal of machine learning

In the three examples presented in chapter 4 — predicting
movie reviews, topic classification, and house-price regression —
we split the data into a training set, a validation set, and a test
set. The reason not to evaluate the models on the same data they were trained
on quickly became evident: after just a few epochs, performance on
never-before-seen data started diverging from performance on the training
data, which always improves as training progresses. The models started to
*overfit*. Overfitting happens in every machine-learning problem.

The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization
and generalization. *Optimization* refers to the process
of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data
(the *learning* in *machine learning*), whereas *generalization* refers to how
well the trained model performs on data it has never seen before. The goal of
the game is to get good generalization, of course, but you don’t control
generalization; you can only fit the model to its training data.
If you do that *too well*, overfitting kicks in and generalization suffers.

But what causes overfitting? How can we achieve good generalization?

### Underfitting and overfitting

For all models you’ve seen in the previous chapter,
performance on the held-out validation data initially improved
as training went on and then inevitably peaked after a while.
This pattern (illustrated in figure 5.1) is universal. You’ll
see it with any model type and any dataset.

![](../images/ch05/typical_overfitting.8bd4c216.png)


[Figure 5.1](#figure-5-1): Canonical overfitting behavior

At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated:
the lower the loss on training data, the lower the loss on test data. While
this is happening, your model is said to be *underfit*: there is still
progress to be made; the network hasn’t yet modeled all relevant patterns in
the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training
data, generalization stops improving, and validation metrics stall and then
begin to degrade: the model is starting to overfit. That is, it’s beginning to
learn patterns that are specific to the training data but that are misleading
or irrelevant when it comes to new data.

Overfitting is particularly likely to occur when your data is noisy, if it
involves uncertainty, or if it includes rare features.
Let’s look at concrete examples.

#### Noisy training data

In real-world datasets, it’s fairly common for some inputs to be invalid.
Perhaps a MNIST digit could be an all-black image, for instance —
or something like figure 5.2.

![](../images/ch05/weird_mnist.84598aa0.png)


[Figure 5.2](#figure-5-2): Some pretty weird MNIST training samples

What are these? We don’t know either. But they’re all part of the MNIST
training set. What’s even worse, however, is having
perfectly valid inputs that end up mislabeled, like those shown in figure 5.3.

![](../images/ch05/mislabeled_mnist.e7a71e65.png)


[Figure 5.3](#figure-5-3): Mislabeled MNIST training samples

If a model goes out of its way to incorporate such outliers, its generalization
performance will degrade, as shown in figure 5.4.
For instance, a 4 that looks very close to the mislabeled 4 in figure 5.3 may end
up getting classified as a 9.

![](../images/ch05/outliers_and_overfitting.919c6421.png)


[Figure 5.4](#figure-5-4): Dealing with outliers: robust fit vs. overfitting

#### Ambiguous features

Not all data noise comes from inaccuracies — even perfectly clean and neatly
labeled data can be noisy when the problem involves uncertainty and ambiguity (see figure 5.5).
In classification tasks, it is often the case that some
regions of the input feature space are associated with multiple classes at the
same time. Let’s say you’re developing a model that takes an image of a banana
and predicts whether the banana is unripened, ripe, or rotten. These categories
have no objective boundaries, so the same picture might be classified as
either unripened or ripe by different human labelers. Similarly,
many problems involve randomness. You could use atmospheric pressure data
to predict whether it will rain tomorrow, but the exact same measurements
may be followed sometimes by rain, sometimes by a clear sky — with some probability.

![](../images/ch05/overfitting_with_uncertainty.7eace2a5.png)


[Figure 5.5](#figure-5-5): Robust fit vs. overfitting giving an ambiguous area of the feature space

A model could overfit to such probabilistic data by being too confident about
ambiguous regions of the feature space, like in figure 5.6. A more
robust fit would ignore individual data points and look at the bigger
picture.

#### Rare features and spurious correlations

If you’ve only ever seen two orange tabby cats in your life, and they both
happened to be terribly antisocial, you might infer that orange tabby cats
are generally likely to be antisocial. That’s overfitting: if you had been
exposed to a wider variety of cats, including more orange ones,
you’d have learned that cat color is not well correlated with character.

Likewise, machine learning models trained on datasets that include rare feature
values are highly susceptible to overfitting. In a sentiment classification task,
if the word “cherimoya” (a fruit native to the Andes)
only appears in one text in the training data,
and this text happens to be negative in sentiment, a poorly regularized
model might put a very high weight on this word and always classify new texts
that mention cherimoyas as negative, whereas, objectively,
there’s nothing negative about the cherimoya.
[[1]](#footnote-1)

Importantly, a feature value doesn’t need to occur only a couple of times
to lead to spurious correlations.
Consider a word that occurs in 100 samples in your training
data, and that’s associated with a positive sentiment 54% of the time and
with a negative sentiment 46% of the time.
That difference may well be a complete statistical fluke, yet
your model is likely to learn to use that feature for its classification
task. This is one of the most common sources of overfitting.

Here’s a striking example. Take MNIST.
Create a new training set by concatenating 784 white noise dimensions
to the existing 784 dimensions of the data — so half of the data is now noise.
For comparison, also create an equivalent dataset by
concatenating 784 all-zeros dimensions. Our concatenation of meaningless
features does not at all affect the information content of the data: we’re
only adding irrelevant data points. Human classification accuracy wouldn’t be affected
by these transformations at all.

```python
from keras.datasets import mnist
import numpy as np

(train_images, train_labels), _ = mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))
train_images = train_images.astype("float32") / 255

train_images_with_noise_channels = np.concatenate(
    [train_images, np.random.random((len(train_images), 784))], axis=1
)

train_images_with_zeros_channels = np.concatenate(
    [train_images, np.zeros((len(train_images), 784))], axis=1
)
```

[Listing 5.1](#listing-5-1): Adding white noise channels or all-zeros channels to MNIST

Now, let’s train the model from chapter 2 on both of these training sets.

```python
import keras
from keras import layers

def get_model():
    model = keras.Sequential(
        [
            layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
            layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
        ]
    )
    model.compile(
        optimizer="adam",
        loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
        metrics=["accuracy"],
    )
    return model

model = get_model()
history_noise = model.fit(
    train_images_with_noise_channels,
    train_labels,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2,
)

model = get_model()
history_zeros = model.fit(
    train_images_with_zeros_channels,
    train_labels,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2,
)
```

[Listing 5.2](#listing-5-2): Training the same model on MNIST data with noise channels or all-zero channels

Despite the data holding the same information in both cases,
the validation accuracy of the model trained with noise channels ends up about
one percentage point lower — purely through the influence of
spurious correlations (figure 5.6). The more noise channels you might add, the further accuracy
would degrade.

![](../images/ch05/mnist_with_added_noise_channels_or_zeros_channels.0d1878dc.png)


[Figure 5.6](#figure-5-6): Effect of noise channels on validation accuracy

Noisy features inevitably lead to overfitting.
As such, in cases where you aren’t
sure whether the features you have are informative or distracting,
it’s common to do *feature selection* before training. Restricting the IMDB data
to the top 10,000 most common words was a crude form of feature selection, for
instance. The typical way to do feature selection is to compute some
usefulness score for each feature available — a measure of
how informative the feature is with respect to the task, such as the
mutual information between the feature and the labels — and only keep features
that are above some threshold. Doing this would filter out the white noise
channels in the preceding example.

### The nature of generalization in deep learning

A remarkable fact about deep learning models is that they can be trained to
fit anything, as long as they have enough representational power.

Don’t believe me? Try shuffling the order of the MNIST labels and train a model on that.
Even though there is no relationship whatsoever between the inputs and
the shuffled labels, the training loss goes down just fine,
even with a relatively small model. Naturally, the validation loss does not
improve at all over time, since there is no possibility of generalization in
this setting.

```python
(train_images, train_labels), _ = mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))
train_images = train_images.astype("float32") / 255

# Copies train_labels
random_train_labels = train_labels[:]
np.random.shuffle(random_train_labels)

model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
model.fit(
    train_images,
    random_train_labels,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2,
)
```

[Listing 5.3](#listing-5-3): Fitting an MNIST model with randomly shuffled labels

In fact, you don’t even need to do this with MNIST data — you could just
generate white noise inputs and random labels. You could fit a model on that,
too, as long as it has enough parameters. It would just end up memorizing
specific inputs, much like a Python dictionary.

If this is the case, then why do deep learning models generalize at all?
Shouldn’t they just learn an ad hoc mapping between training inputs and targets,
like a fancy `dict`? What expectation can we have that this mapping will work
for new inputs?

As it turns out, the nature of generalization in deep learning
has rather little to do with deep learning models themselves
and much to do with the structure of information in the real world.
Let’s take a look at what’s really going on here.

#### The manifold hypothesis

The input to an MNIST classifier (before preprocessing)
is a 28 × 28 array of integers between 0 and 255. The total number of
possible input values is thus 256 to the power of 784 — much greater
than the number of atoms in the universe. However, very few of these inputs
would look like valid MNIST samples: actual handwritten digits only occupy
a tiny *subspace* of the parent space of all possible 28 x 28 `uint8` arrays.
What’s more, this subspace isn’t just a set of points sprinkled at random
in the parent space: it is highly structured.

First, the subspace of valid handwritten digits is *continuous*:
if you take a sample and modify it a little, it will still be
recognizable as the same handwritten digit. Further, all samples in the valid
subspace are *connected* by smooth paths that run through the subspace.
This means that if you take two random MNIST digits A and B, there exists a
sequence of “intermediate” images that morph A into B, such that two
consecutive digits are very close to each other (see figure 5.7). Perhaps
there will be a few ambiguous shapes close to the boundary between two classes,
but even these shapes would still look very digit-like.

![](../images/ch05/mnist_manifold.665acfb1.png)


[Figure 5.7](#figure-5-7): Different MNIST digits gradually morphing into one another, showing that the space of handwritten digits forms a “manifold.” This image was generated using code from chapter 17.

In technical terms, you would say that handwritten digits form a *manifold*
within the space of possible 28 × 28 `uint8` arrays. That’s a big word, but
the concept is pretty intuitive. A manifold is a lower-dimensional subspace
of some parent space that is locally similar to a linear (Euclidean) space.
For instance, a smooth curve in the plane is a 1D manifold within a 2D space
because for every point of the curve, you can draw a tangent (the curve
can be approximated by a line in every point). A smooth surface within a 3D
space is a 2D manifold. And so on.

More generally, the *manifold hypothesis* posits that all natural data lies
on a low-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional space where
it is encoded. That’s a pretty strong statement about the structure of
information in the universe. As far as we know, it’s accurate,
and it’s the reason why deep learning works. It’s true for MNIST digits,
as well as for human faces, tree morphology, the sounds of the human voice,
and even natural language.

The manifold hypothesis implies

* Machine learning models only have to fit relatively simple,
  low-dimensional, highly structured subspaces within their potential input space
  (latent manifolds).
* Within one of these manifolds, it’s always possible to *interpolate*
  between two inputs — that is, morph one into another via a continuous
  path along which all points fall on the manifold.

The ability to interpolate between samples is the key to
understanding generalization in deep learning.

#### Interpolation as a source of generalization

If you work with data points that can be interpolated, you can start making
sense of points you’ve never seen before by relating them to other points
that lie close on the manifold. In other words, you can make sense of
the *totality* of the space using only a *sample* of the space. You can use
interpolation to fill in the blanks.

Note that interpolation on the latent manifold is different from linear
interpolation in the parent space, as illustrated in figure 5.8.
For instance, the average of pixels between two MNIST digits is usually not a valid digit.

![](../images/ch05/linear_interpolation_vs_manifold_interpolation.75960718.png)


[Figure 5.8](#figure-5-8): Difference between linear interpolation and interpolation on the latent manifold. Every point on the latent manifold of digits is a valid digit, but the average of two digits usually isn’t.

Crucially, while deep learning achieves generalization via interpolation
on a learned approximation of the data manifold, it would be a mistake
to assume that interpolation is *all* there is to generalization. It’s the tip
of the iceberg. Interpolation can only help you make sense of things that are
very close to what you’ve seen before: it enables *local generalization*.
But remarkably, humans deal with extreme novelty all the time,
and they do just fine. You don’t need to be trained in advance on countless
examples of every situation you’ll ever have to encounter.
Every single one of your days is different from any day
you’ve experienced before, and different from any day experienced by anyone
since the dawn of humanity. You can switch between spending a week in NYC,
a week in Shanghai, and a week in Bangalore
without requiring thousands of lifetimes of learning and rehearsal
for each city.

Humans are capable of *extreme generalization*,
which is enabled by cognitive mechanisms other than interpolation —
abstraction, symbolic models of the world, reasoning, logic, common sense,
innate priors about the world — what we generally call *reason*, as opposed
to intuition and pattern recognition.
The latter are largely interpolative in nature, but the former isn’t. Both are
essential to intelligence. We’ll talk more about this in chapter 19.

#### Why deep learning works

Remember the crumpled paper ball metaphor from chapter 2? A sheet of paper
represents a 2D manifold within 3D space (figure 5.9). A deep learning model is a
tool for uncrumpling paper balls — that is, for disentangling
latent manifolds.

![](../images/ch02/geometric_interpretation_4.f8123b83.png)


[Figure 5.9](#figure-5-9): Uncrumpling a complicated manifold of data

A deep learning model is basically a very high-dimensional curve.
The curve is smooth and continuous (with additional constraints on its structure,
originating from model architecture priors) because it needs to be differentiable.
And that curve is fitted to data points via gradient descent — smoothly and incrementally.
*By construction*, deep learning is about taking a big, complex curve — a manifold —
and incrementally adjusting its parameters until it fits some training data points.

The curve involves enough
parameters that it could fit anything. Indeed, if you let your model train for
long enough, it will effectively end up purely memorizing its training data
and won’t generalize at all. However, the data you’re fitting to isn’t made of
isolated points sparsely distributed across the underlying space.
Your data forms a highly structured, low-dimensional manifold within the input space
— that’s the manifold hypothesis. And because fitting your model curve to this data
happens gradually and smoothly over time, as gradient descent progresses,
there will be an intermediate point during training at which the model
roughly approximates the natural manifold of the data,
as you can see in figure 5.10.

![](../images/ch05/the_cartoon_of_fitting.096e7b07.png)


[Figure 5.10](#figure-5-10): Going from a random model to an overfit model and achieving a robust fit as an intermediate state

Moving along the curve learned by the model at
that point will come close to moving along the actual latent manifold of
the data. As such, the model will be capable of making sense of
never-before-seen inputs via interpolation between training inputs.

Besides the trivial fact that they have sufficient representational power,
there are a few properties of deep learning models that make
them particularly well suited to learning latent manifolds:

* Deep learning models implement a smooth, continuous mapping from their
  inputs to their outputs. It has to be smooth and continuous because it
  must be differentiable, by necessity (you couldn’t do gradient descent
  otherwise). This smoothness helps approximate latent manifolds,
  which follow the same properties.
* Deep learning models tend to be structured in a way that mirrors the “shape”
  of the information in their training data (via architecture priors). This
  is the case in particular for image-processing models (see chapters 8–12)
  and sequence-processing models (see chapter 13). More generally,
  deep neural networks structure their learned representations in a hierarchical
  and modular way, which echoes the way natural data is organized.

#### Training data is paramount

While deep learning is indeed well suited to manifold learning, the power to
generalize is more a consequence of the natural structure
of your data than a consequence of any property of your model. You’ll only be
able to generalize if your data forms a manifold where points can be
interpolated. The more informative and the less noisy your features are,
the better you will be able to generalize, since your input space will be
simpler and better structured. Data curation and feature engineering are
essential to generalization.

Further, because deep learning is curve fitting, for a model to perform well,
*it needs to be trained on a dense sampling of its input space*.
A “dense sampling” in this context means that the training data should densely
cover the entirety of the input data manifold (see figure 5.11). This is
especially true near decision boundaries. With a sufficiently dense sampling,
it becomes possible to make sense of new inputs by interpolating between past
training inputs, without having to use common-sense, abstract reasoning,
or external knowledge about the world — all things that machine learning models
have no access to.

![](../images/ch05/dense_sampling.c8a0767c.png)


[Figure 5.11](#figure-5-11): A dense sampling of the input space is necessary to learn a model capable of accurate generalization.

As such, you should always keep in mind that the best way to improve a deep
learning model is to train it on more data or better data
(of course, adding overly noisy or inaccurate data will harm generalization).
A denser coverage of the input data manifold will yield a model that
generalizes better. You should never expect a deep learning model to perform
anything more than crude interpolation between its training samples, and thus,
you should do everything you can to make interpolation as easy as possible.
The only thing you will find in a deep learning model is what you put into it:
the priors encoded in its architecture and the data it was trained on.

When getting more data isn’t possible, the next-best solution is to modulate
the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add
constraints on the smoothness of the model curve. If a network can
only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, or very regular patterns,
the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns,
which have a better chance of generalizing well. The process of fighting
overfitting this way is called *regularization*. We’ll review regularization
techniques in depth in section 5.4.4.

Before you can start tweaking your model to help it generalize better,
you need a way to assess how your model is currently doing. In the following
section, you’ll learn about how you can monitor generalization during
model development: model evaluation.

## Evaluating machine-learning models

You can only control what you can observe. Since your goal is to develop
models that can successfully generalize to new data, it’s essential to
be able to reliably measure the generalization power of your model.
In this section, we’ll formally introduce the different ways you can evaluate
machine learning models. You’ve already seen most of them in action in the
previous chapter.

### Training, validation, and test sets

Evaluating a model always boils down to splitting the
available data into three sets: training, validation, and test. You train on
the training data and evaluate your model on the validation data. Once your
model is ready for prime time, you test it one final time on the test data, which
is meant to be as similar as possible to production data. Then you can deploy
the model in production.

You may ask, why not have two sets: a training set and a test set? You’d train
on the training data and evaluate on the test data. Much simpler!

The reason is that developing a model always involves tuning its configuration:
for example, choosing the number of layers or the size of the layers (called
the *hyperparameters* of the model, to distinguish them
from the *parameters*, which are the network’s weights). You do
this tuning by using as a feedback signal the performance of the model on the
validation data. In essence, this tuning is a form of *learning*: a search
for a good configuration in some parameter space. As a result, tuning the
configuration of the model based on its performance on the validation set can
quickly result in *overfitting to the validation set*,
even though your model is never directly trained on it.

Central to this phenomenon is the notion of *information leaks*.
Every time you tune a hyperparameter of your model based on the
model’s performance on the validation set, some information about the
validation data leaks into the model. If you do this only once, for one
parameter, then very few bits of information will leak, and your validation
set will remain reliable to evaluate the model. But if you repeat this many
times — running one experiment, evaluating on the validation set, and modifying
your model as a result — then you’ll leak an increasingly significant amount of
information about the validation set into the model.

At the end of the day, you’ll end up with a model that performs artificially
well on the validation data because that’s what you optimized it for. You
care about performance on completely new data, not the validation data, so you
need to use a completely different, never-before-seen dataset to evaluate the
model: the test dataset. Your model shouldn’t have had access to *any*
information about the test set, even indirectly. If anything about the model
has been tuned based on test set performance, then your measure of
generalization will be flawed.

Splitting your data into training, validation, and test
sets may seem straightforward, but there are a few advanced ways to do it that
can come in handy when little data is available. Let’s review three classic
evaluation recipes: simple hold-out validation, K-fold validation, and
iterated K-fold validation with shuffling. We’ll also talk about the use
of common-sense baselines to check that your training is going somewhere.

#### Simple hold-out validation

Set apart some fraction of your data
as your test set. Train on the remaining data, and evaluate on the test set.
As you saw in the previous sections, to prevent information leaks,
you shouldn’t tune your model based on the test set, and therefore you should
*also* reserve a validation set.

Schematically, hold-out validation looks like figure
5.12. The following listing shows a simple implementation.

![](../images/ch05/holdout_validation.55d20cbc.png)


[Figure 5.12](#figure-5-12): Simple hold-out validation split



```python
num_validation_samples = 10000
# Shuffling the data is usually appropriate.
np.random.shuffle(data)
# Defines the validation set
validation_data = data[:num_validation_samples]
# Defines the training set
training_data = data[num_validation_samples:]
# Trains a model on the training data and evaluates it on the
# validation data
model = get_model()
model.fit(training_data, ...)
validation_score = model.evaluate(validation_data, ...)

# At this point, you can tune your model, retrain it, evaluate it, tune
# it again, and so on.
...

# Once you've tuned your hyperparameters, it's common to train your
# final model from scratch on all non-test data available.
model = get_model()
model.fit(
    np.concatenate([training_data, validation_data]),
    ...,
)
test_score = model.evaluate(test_data, ...)
```

[Listing 5.4](#listing-5-4): Hold-out validation (note that labels are omitted for simplicity)

This is the simplest evaluation protocol, and it suffers from one flaw: if
little data is available, then your validation and test sets may contain too
few samples to be statistically representative of the data at hand. This is
easy to recognize: if different random shuffling rounds of the data before
splitting end up yielding very different measures of model performance, then
you’re having this issue. K-fold validation and iterated K‑fold validation are
two ways to address this, as discussed next.

#### K-fold validation

With this approach, you split your data
into `K` partitions of equal size. For each partition `i`,
train a model on the remaining `K - 1` partitions and evaluate it on
partition `i`. Your final score is then the averages of the K scores obtained.
This method is helpful when the performance of your model shows significant
variance based on your train/test split. Like hold-out validation, this method
doesn’t exempt you from using a distinct validation set for model calibration.

Schematically, K-fold cross-validation looks like figure 5.13. Listing 5.6 shows
a simple implementation.

![](../images/ch05/k_fold_validation.1fd60660.png)


[Figure 5.13](#figure-5-13): Three-fold validation



```python
k = 3
num_validation_samples = len(data) // k
np.random.shuffle(data)
validation_scores = []
for fold in range(k):
    # Selects the validation-data partition
    validation_data = data[
        num_validation_samples * fold : num_validation_samples * (fold + 1)
    ]
    # Uses the remainder of the data as training data.
    training_data = np.concatenate(
        data[: num_validation_samples * fold],
        data[num_validation_samples * (fold + 1) :],
    )
    # Creates a brand-new instance of the model (untrained)
    model = get_model()
    model.fit(training_data, ...)
    validation_score = model.evaluate(validation_data, ...)
    validation_scores.append(validation_score)
# Validation score: average of the validation scores of the k folds
validation_score = np.average(validation_scores)
# Trains the final model on all non-test data available
model = get_model()
model.fit(data, ...)
test_score = model.evaluate(test_data, ...)
```

[Listing 5.5](#listing-5-5): K-fold cross-validation (note that labels are omitted for simplicity)

#### Iterated K-fold validation with shuffling

This one is for situations in which you have relatively little data available
and you need to evaluate your model as precisely as possible.
I’ve found it to be extremely
helpful in Kaggle competitions. It consists of applying K-fold validation
multiple times, shuffling the data every time before splitting it `K` ways.
The final score is the average of the scores obtained at each run of K-fold
validation. Note that you end up training and evaluating `P * K` models (where
`P` is the number of iterations you use), which can be very expensive.

### Beating a common-sense baseline

Besides the different evaluation protocols you have available, one last thing
you should know about is the use of common-sense baselines.

Training a deep learning model is a bit like pressing a button that launches
a rocket in a parallel world. You can’t hear it or see it. You
can’t observe the manifold learning process — it’s happening in a space with
thousands of dimensions, and even if you projected it to 3D, you couldn’t
interpret it. The only feedback you have is your validation metrics —
like an altitude meter on your invisible rocket.

A particularly important point is to be able to tell whether you’re getting off
the ground at all. What was the altitude you started at? Your model seems to
have an accuracy of 15%, is that any good? Before you start working with a
dataset, you should always pick a trivial baseline that you’ll try to
beat. If you cross that threshold, you’ll know you’re doing something right:
your model is actually using the information in the input data to make
predictions that generalize — you can keep going.
This baseline could be performance of a random classifier,
or the performance of the simplest non-machine learning technique
you can imagine.

For instance, in the MNIST digit-classification example,
a simple baseline would be a validation accuracy greater than 0.1
(random classifier); in the IMDB example, it would be a validation accuracy
greater than 0.5. In the Reuters example, it would be around 0.18–0.19,
due to class imbalance. If you have a binary classification problem
where 90% of samples belong to class A and 10% belong to class B, then a
classifier that always predicts A already achieves 0.9 in validation accuracy,
and you’ll need to do better than that.

Having a common sense baseline you can refer to is essential when you’re
getting started on a problem no one has solved before. If you can’t beat
a trivial solution, your model is worthless — perhaps you’re using the
wrong model or perhaps the problem you’re tackling can’t even be approached
with machine learning in the first place. Time to go back to the drawing board.

### Things to keep in mind about model evaluation

Keep an eye out for the following when you’re choosing an evaluation protocol:

* *Data representativeness*  — You want both your
  training set and test set to be representative of the data at hand. For
  instance, if you’re trying to classify images of digits, and you’re starting
  from an array of samples where the samples are ordered by their class, taking
  the first 80% of the array as your training set and the remaining 20% as your
  test set will result in your training set containing only classes 0–7, whereas
  your test set contains only classes 8–9. This seems like a ridiculous mistake,
  but it’s surprisingly common. For this reason, you usually should *randomly
  shuffle* your data before splitting it into training and test sets.

* *The arrow of time*  — If you’re trying to predict the
  future given the past (for example, tomorrow’s weather, stock movements, and
  so on), you should not randomly shuffle your data before splitting it because
  doing so will create a *temporal leak*: your model will
  effectively be trained on data from the future. In such situations, you should
  always make sure all data in your test set is *posterior* to the data in the
  training set.

* *Redundancy in your data*  — If some data points in
  your data appear twice (fairly common with real-world data), then shuffling
  the data and splitting it into a training set and a validation set will result
  in redundancy between the training and validation sets. In effect, you’ll be
  testing on part of your training data, which is the worst thing you can do!
  Make sure your training set and validation set are disjoint.

Having a reliable way to evaluate the performance of your
model is how you’ll be able to monitor the tension
at the heart of machine learning — between optimization and generalization,
underfitting and overfitting.

## Improving model fit

To achieve the perfect fit, you must first overfit. Since you don’t know
in advance where the boundary lies, you must cross it to find it. Thus, your
initial goal as you start working on a problem is to achieve a model that
shows some generalization power, and that is able to overfit. Once you have
such a model, you’ll focus on refining generalization by fighting overfitting.

There are three common problems you’ll encounter at this stage:

* Training doesn’t get started: your training loss doesn’t go down over time.
* Training gets started just fine, but your model doesn’t meaningfully
  generalize: you can’t beat the common-sense baseline you set.
* Training and validation loss both go down over time, and you can beat
  your baseline, but you don’t seem to be able to overfit, which indicates
  you’re still underfitting.

Let’s see how you can address these issues to achieve the first big milestone
of a machine learning project: getting a model that has some
generalization power (it can beat a trivial baseline) and is able to
overfit.

### Tuning key gradient descent parameters

Sometimes, training doesn’t get started or stalls too early.
Your loss is stuck. This is *always* something you can overcome: remember that
you can fit a model to random data. Even if nothing about your problem makes
sense, you should *still* be able to train something —
if only by memorizing the training data.

When this happens, it’s always a problem with the configuration of the
gradient descent process: your choice of optimizer, the distribution of initial
values in the weights of your model, your learning rate, or your batch size.
All these parameters are interdependent, and as such, it is usually sufficient
to tune the learning rate and the batch size while maintaining the rest of
the parameters constant.

Let’s look at a concrete example: let’s train the MNIST model from
chapter 2 with an inappropriately large learning rate, of value 1.

```python
(train_images, train_labels), _ = mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))
train_images = train_images.astype("float32") / 255

model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=1.0),
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
model.fit(
    train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.2
)
```

[Listing 5.6](#listing-5-6): Training an MNIST model with an incorrectly high learning rate

The model quickly reaches a training and validation accuracy in the 20% to 40%
range, but cannot get past that. Let’s try to lower the learning rate to
a more reasonable value of `1e-2`:

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=1e-2),
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
model.fit(
    train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.2
)
```

[Listing 5.7](#listing-5-7): The same model with a more appropriate learning rate

The model is now able to train.

If you find yourself in a similar situation, try

* Lowering or increasing the learning rate. A learning rate that is too high
  may lead to updates that vastly overshoot a proper fit,
  like in the previous example, and a learning
  rate that is too low may make training so slow that it appears to stall.
* Increasing the batch size. A batch with more samples will lead to gradients
  that are more informative and less noisy (lower variance).

You will, eventually, find a configuration that gets training started.

### Using better architecture priors

You have a model that fits, but for some reason your validation metrics
aren’t improving at all. They remain no better than what a random classifier
would achieve: your model trains, but doesn’t generalize. What’s going on?

This is perhaps the worst machine learning situation you can find yourself in.
It indicates that *something is fundamentally wrong with your approach*, and
it may not be easy to tell what. Here are some tips.

First, it may be that the input data you’re using simply doesn’t contain
sufficient information to predict your targets: the problem as formulated is
not solvable. This is what happened earlier when we tried to fit an MNIST model
where the labels were shuffled: the model would train just fine,
but validation accuracy would stay stuck at 10%,
because it was plainly impossible to generalize with such a dataset.

It may also be that the kind of model you’re using is not suited for the problem
at hand. For instance, in chapter 13, you’ll see an example of a timeseries
prediction problem where a densely connected architecture isn’t able to beat
a trivial baseline, whereas a more appropriate
recurrent architecture does manage to generalize well.
Using a model that makes the right assumptions about the problem is essential
to achieve generalization: you should use the right architecture priors.

In the following chapters, you’ll learn about the best architectures to use
for a variety of data modalities — images, text, timeseries, and so on. In
general, you should always make sure to read up on architecture
best practices for the kind of task you’re attacking —
chances are you’re not the first person to attempt it.

### Increasing model capacity

If you manage to get to a model that fits, where validation metrics are going
down, and that seems to achieve at least some level of generalization power,
congratulations: you’re almost there. Next, you need to get your model to
start overfitting.

Consider the following small model — a simple logistic regression —
trained on MNIST pixels.

```python
model = keras.Sequential([layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")])
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_small_model = model.fit(
    train_images, train_labels, epochs=20, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.2
)
```

[Listing 5.8](#listing-5-8): A simple logistic regression on MNIST

You get loss curves that look like this (see figure 5.14):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

val_loss = history_small_model.history["val_loss"]
epochs = range(1, 21)
plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, "b-", label="Validation loss")
plt.title("Validation loss for a model with insufficient capacity")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


![](../images/ch05/effect_of_insufficient_model_capacity_on_val_loss.3a003173.png)


[Figure 5.14](#figure-5-14): Effect of insufficient model capacity on loss curves

Validation metrics seem to stall or to improve very slowly,
instead of peaking and reversing course. The validation loss goes
to 0.26 and just stays there. You can fit, but you can’t
clearly overfit, even after many iterations over the
training data. You’re likely to encounter similar curves often in your career.

Remember that it should always be possible to overfit. Much like the problem
“the training loss doesn’t go down,” this is an issue that can always be solved.
If you can’t seem to be able to overfit,
it’s likely a problem with the *representational power* of your
model: you’re going to need a bigger model, one with more *capacity* —
that is, able to store more information. You can increase representational
power by adding more layers, using bigger layers (layers with more parameters),
or using kinds of layers that are more appropriate for the problem at hand
(better architecture priors).

Let’s try training a bigger model, one with two intermediate layers with 128
units each:

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_large_model = model.fit(
    train_images,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2,
)
```

The training curves now look exactly like they should: the model fits
fast and starts overfitting after eight epochs (see figure 5.15):

![](../images/ch05/effect_of_correct_model_capacity_on_val_loss.1b765d5c.png)


[Figure 5.15](#figure-5-15): Validation loss for a model with appropriate capacity

Note that while it is standard to work with models that are way
overparameterized for the problem at hand,
there can definitely be such a thing as *too much*
memorization capacity. You’ll know your model is too large if it starts
overfitting right away. Here’s what happens for an MNIST
model with three intermediate layers with 2,048 units each (see figure 5.16):

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(2048, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(2048, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(2048, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_very_large_model = model.fit(
    train_images,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    # When training larger models, you can reduce the batch size to
    # limit memory consumption.
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,
)
```

[Figure 5.16](#figure-5-16): Effect of excessive model capacity on validation loss

## Improving generalization

Once your model has shown to have some generalization power and to be able
to overfit, it’s time to switch your focus toward maximizing generalization.

### Dataset curation

You’ve already learned that generalization in deep learning originates from the
latent structure of your data. If your data makes it possible to smoothly
interpolate between samples, then you will be able to train a deep learning
model that generalizes. If your problem is overly noisy or fundamentally
discrete, like, say, list sorting, deep learning will not help you.
Deep learning is curve fitting, not magic.

As such, it is essential that you make sure that you’re working with an
appropriate dataset. Spending more effort and money on data collection almost
always yields a much greater return on investment than spending the same
on developing a better model:

* Make sure you have enough data. Remember that you need a *dense sampling*
  of the input-cross-output space. More data will yield a better model.
  Sometimes, problems that seem impossible at first
  become solvable with a larger dataset.
* Minimize labeling errors — visualize your inputs to check for anomalies,
  and proofread your labels.
* Clean your data and deal with missing values (we cover this in the next chapter).
* If you have many features and you aren’t sure which ones are actually
  useful, do feature selection.

A particularly important way you can improve the generalization potential
of your data is *feature engineering*. For most machine learning problems,
*feature engineering* is a key ingredient for success. Let’s take a look.

### Feature engineering

*Feature engineering* is the process of using your own knowledge about the data
and about the machine learning algorithm at hand (in this case, a neural
network) to make the algorithm work better by applying hardcoded (non-learned)
transformations to the data before it goes into the model. In many cases, it
isn’t reasonable to expect a machine learning model to be able to learn from
completely arbitrary data. The data needs to be presented to the model in a
way that will make the model’s job easier.

Let’s look at an intuitive example. Suppose you’re trying to develop a model
that can take as input an image of a clock and can output the time of day (see
figure 5.17). If you choose to use the raw pixels of the image as input data, then you have a
difficult machine learning problem on your hands. You’ll need a convolutional
neural network to solve it, and you’ll have to expend quite a bit of
computational resources to train the network.

![](../images/ch05/clock_diagram.3cbff177.png)


[Figure 5.17](#figure-5-17): Feature engineering for reading the time on a clock

But if you already understand the problem at a high level (you understand how
humans read time on a clock face), then you can come up with much better input
features for a machine learning algorithm: for instance, it’s easy to write a
five-line Python script to follow the black pixels of the clock hands and
output the `(x, y)` coordinates of the tip of each hand. Then a simple
machine learning algorithm can learn to associate these coordinates with the
appropriate time of day.

You can go even further: do a coordinate change and express the `(x, y)`
coordinates as polar coordinates with regard to the center of the image. Your
input will become the angle `theta` of each clock hand. At this point, your
features are making the problem so easy that no machine learning is required;
a simple rounding operation and dictionary lookup are enough to recover the
approximate time of day.

That’s the essence of feature engineering: making a problem easier by
expressing it in a simpler way. Make the latent manifold
smoother, simpler, and better organized.
It usually requires understanding the problem in depth.

Before deep learning, feature engineering used to be the most important
part of the machine learning workflow because
classical shallow algorithms didn’t have hypothesis spaces rich enough to
learn useful features by themselves. The way you presented the data to the
algorithm was absolutely critical to its success.
For instance, before convolutional neural networks became successful
on the MNIST digit-classification problem,
solutions were typically based on hardcoded features such as the number of
loops in a digit image, the height of each digit in an image, a histogram of
pixel values, and so on.

Fortunately, modern deep learning removes the need for most feature
engineering because neural networks are capable of automatically extracting
useful features from raw data. Does this mean you don’t have to worry about
feature engineering as long as you’re using deep neural networks? No, for two
reasons:

* Good features still allow you to solve problems more elegantly while
  using fewer resources. For instance, it would be ridiculous to solve the
  problem of reading a clock face using a convolutional neural network.
* Good features let you solve a problem with far less data. The ability of
  deep-learning models to learn features on their own relies on having lots of
  training data available; if you have only a few samples, then the information
  value in their features becomes critical.

### Using early stopping

In deep learning, we always use models that are vastly overparameterized:
they have way more degrees of freedom than the minimum necessary to fit to
the latent manifold of the data. This overparameterization is not an issue
because *you never fully fit a deep learning model*.
Such a fit wouldn’t generalize at all. You will always interrupt training
long before you’ve reached the minimum possible training loss.

Finding the exact point during training where you’ve reached the most
generalizable fit — the exact boundary between an underfit curve
and an overfit curve — is one of the most effective things you can do
to improve generalization.

In the examples from the previous chapter, we would start by training our
models for longer than needed to figure out the number of epochs that yielded
the best validation metrics, then we would retrain a new model for exactly
that number of epochs. This is pretty standard. However, it requires you to
do redundant work, which can sometimes be expensive. Naturally, you
could just save your model at the end of each epoch, then once you’ve found the
best epoch, reuse the closest saved model you have. In Keras, it’s
typical to do this with an `EarlyStopping` callback, which will interrupt
training as soon as validation metrics have stopped improving, while remembering
the best known model state. You’ll learn to use callbacks in chapter 7.

### Regularizing your model

*Regularization techniques* are a set of best practices that
actively impede the model’s ability to fit perfectly to the training data,
with the goal of making the model perform better during validation.
This is called “regularizing” the model because it
tends to make the model simpler, more “regular,” its curve smoother, and
more “generic” — thus less specific to the training set and better
able to generalize by more closely approximating the latent manifold
of the data. Keep in mind that “regularizing” a model is a process that should always
be guided by an accurate evaluation procedure.
You will only achieve generalization if you can measure it.

Let’s review some of the most common regularization techniques and apply them
in practice to improve the movie classification model from chapter 4.

#### Reducing the network’s size

You’ve already learned that a model that is too small will not overfit.
The simplest way to mitigate overfitting is to reduce the size of the model
(the number of learnable parameters in the model, determined by the
number of layers and the number of units per layer). If the model has limited
memorization resources, it won’t be able to simply memorize its training data.
To minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed
representations that have predictive power regarding the targets — precisely
the type of representations we’re interested in. At the same time,
keep in mind that you should use models
that have enough parameters that they don’t underfit: your model shouldn’t be
starved for memorization resources. There is a compromise to be found between
*too much capacity* and *not enough capacity*.

Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine the right number of
layers or the right size for each layer. You must evaluate an array of
different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of
course) to find the correct model size for your data. The general
workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few
layers and parameters and increase the size of the layers or add new layers
until you see diminishing returns with regard to validation loss.

Let’s try this on the movie-review classification model. Here’s a condensed
version of the model from chapter 4.

```python
from keras.datasets import imdb

(train_data, train_labels), _ = imdb.load_data(num_words=10000)

def vectorize_sequences(sequences, dimension=10000):
    results = np.zeros((len(sequences), dimension))
    for i, sequence in enumerate(sequences):
        results[i, sequence] = 1.0
    return results

train_data = vectorize_sequences(train_data)

model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(16, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(16, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="binary_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_original = model.fit(
    train_data,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_split=0.4,
)
```

[Listing 5.9](#listing-5-9): Original model

Now let’s try to replace it with this smaller model.

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(4, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(4, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="binary_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_smaller_model = model.fit(
    train_data,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_split=0.4,
)
```

[Listing 5.10](#listing-5-10): Version of the model with lower capacity

Figure 5.18 shows a comparison of the validation losses of the original model
and the smaller model.

![](../images/ch05/original_model_vs_smaller_model_imdb.906f7067.png)


[Figure 5.18](#figure-5-18): Original model vs. smaller model on IMDb review classification

As you can see, the smaller model starts overfitting later than the reference
model (after six epochs rather than four), and its performance degrades more
slowly once it starts overfitting.

Now, let’s add to our benchmark a model that has much more capacity — far more
than the problem warrants.

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="binary_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_larger_model = model.fit(
    train_data,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_split=0.4,
)
```

[Listing 5.11](#listing-5-11): Version of the model with higher capacity

Figure 5.19 shows how the bigger model fares compared to the reference
model. The bigger model starts overfitting almost immediately, after just one epoch,
and it overfits much more severely. Its validation loss is also noisier.
It gets training loss near zero very quickly. The
more capacity the model has, the more quickly it can model the training data
(resulting in a low training loss), but the more susceptible it is to
overfitting (resulting in a large difference between the training and
validation loss).

#### Adding weight regularization

You may be familiar with the principle of *Occam’s razor*: given two explanations for
something, the explanation most likely to be correct is the simplest one — the
one that makes fewer assumptions. This idea also applies to the models learned
by neural networks: given some training data and a network architecture,
multiple sets of weight values (multiple *models*) could explain the data.
Simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.

A *simple model* in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter
values has less entropy (or a model with fewer parameters, as you saw in the
previous section). Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put
constraints on the complexity of a model by forcing its weights to take only
small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more *regular*.
This is called *weight regularization*, and it’s done by adding to the loss
function of the model a cost associated with having large weights. This cost
comes in two flavors:

* *L1 regularization*  — The cost added is proportional
  to the *absolute value of the weight coefficients* (the *L1 norm* of the
  weights).

* *L2 regularization* — The cost added is proportional
  to the *square of the value of the weight coefficients* (the *L2 norm* of the
  weights). L2 regularization is also called *weight decay* in
  the context of neural networks. Don’t let the different name confuse you:
  weight decay is mathematically the same as L2 regularization.

In Keras, weight regularization is added by passing
*weight regularizer instances* to layers as keyword arguments.
Let’s add L2 weight regularization
to the movie review classification model.

```python
from keras.regularizers import l2

model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(16, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.002), activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(16, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.002), activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="binary_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_l2_reg = model.fit(
    train_data,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_split=0.4,
)
```

[Listing 5.12](#listing-5-12): Adding L2 weight regularization to the model

`l2(0.002)` means every coefficient in the weight matrix of the layer will add
`0.002 * weight_coefficient_value ** 2` to the total loss of the model. Note that
because this penalty is *only added at training time*, the loss for this
model will be much higher at training than at test time.

Figure 5.20 shows the effect of the L2 regularization penalty. As you can see,
the model with L2 regularization has become much more resistant to
overfitting than the reference model, even though both models have
the same number of parameters: see figure 5.20:

![](../images/ch05/original_model_vs_l2_regularized_model_imdb.2b413ef1.png)


[Figure 5.20](#figure-5-20): Effect of L2 weight regularization on validation loss

As an alternative to L2 regularization, you can use one of the following Keras
weight regularizers.

```python
from keras import regularizers

# L1 regularization
regularizers.l1(0.001)
# Simultaneous L1 and L2 regularization
regularizers.l1_l2(l1=0.001, l2=0.001)
```

[Listing 5.13](#listing-5-13): Different weight regularizers available in Keras

Note that weight regularization is more typically used for smaller deep
learning models. Large deep learning models tend to be so overparameterized
that imposing constraints on weight values does not have much effect on
model capacity and generalization.
In these cases, a different regularization technique is preferred: *dropout*.

#### Adding dropout

*Dropout*, developed by
Geoff Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto, is one of the most effective and
most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks. Dropout, applied
to a layer, consists of randomly *dropping out* (setting to zero) a number of
output features of the layer during training. Let’s say a given layer would
normally return a vector `[0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1]` for a given input sample
during training. After applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero
entries distributed at random: for example, `[0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]`. The
*dropout rate* is the fraction of the features that are zeroed out; it’s
usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out;
instead, the layer’s output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the
dropout rate, to balance for the fact that more units are active than at
training time.

Consider a NumPy matrix containing the output of a layer, `layer_output`, of
shape `(batch_size, features)`. At training time, we zero-out at random a
fraction of the values in the matrix:

```python
# At training time, drops out 50% of the units in the output
layer_output *= np.random.randint(low=0, high=2, size=layer_output.shape)
```

At test time, we scale down the output by the dropout rate. Here, we scale by
0.5 (because we previously dropped half the units):

```python
# At test time
layer_output *= 0.5
```

Note that this process can be implemented by doing both operations at training
time and leaving the output unchanged at test time, which is often the way
it’s implemented in practice (see figure 5.21):

```python
# At training time
layer_output *= np.random.randint(low=0, high=2, size=layer_output.shape)
# Note that we're scaling up rather scaling down in this case.
layer_output /= 0.5
```

This technique may seem strange and arbitrary. Why would this help reduce
overfitting? Hinton says he was inspired by, among other
things, a fraud-prevention mechanism used by banks:

> would require cooperation between employees to successfully defraud the bank.
> This made me realize that randomly removing a different subset of neurons on

> overfitting.

The core idea is that introducing noise in the output
values of a layer can break up happenstance patterns that aren’t significant
(what Hinton refers to as *conspiracies*), which the model will start
memorizing if no noise is present.

In Keras, you can introduce dropout in a model via the `Dropout` layer, which
is applied to the output of the layer right before it. Let’s add two `Dropout`
layers in the IMDB model to see how well they do at reducing overfitting.

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.Dense(16, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),
        layers.Dense(16, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),
        layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"),
    ]
)
model.compile(
    optimizer="rmsprop",
    loss="binary_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)
history_dropout = model.fit(
    train_data,
    train_labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_split=0.4,
)
```

Figure 5.22 shows a plot of the results.
This is a clear improvement over the reference model.
It also seems to be working much better than L2 regularization since
the lowest validation loss reached has improved:

To recap, these are the most common ways to maximize generalization and
prevent overfitting in neural networks:

* Getting more training data, or better training data
* Developing better features
* Reducing the capacity of the model
* Adding weight regularization (for smaller models)
* Adding dropout

## Summary

* The purpose of a machine learning model is to *generalize*: to perform accurately
  on never-before-seen inputs. It’s harder than it seems.
* A deep neural network achieves generalization by learning a parametric model
  that can successfully *interpolate* between training samples. Such a model
  can be said to have learned the *latent manifold* of the training data.
  This is why deep learning models can only make sense of inputs that are
  very close to what they’ve seen during training.
* The fundamental problem in machine learning is
  *the tension between optimization and generalization*: to attain
  generalization, you must first achieve
  a good fit to the training data, but improving your model’s fit to the training
  data will inevitably start hurting generalization after a while. Every single
  deep learning best practice deals with managing this tension.
* The ability of deep learning models to generalize comes from the fact that
  they manage to learn to approximate the *latent manifold* of their data
  and can thus make sense of new inputs via interpolation.
* It’s essential to be able to accurately evaluate the generalization power of
  your model while you’re developing it. You have at your disposal an array
  of evaluation methods, from simple hold-out validation to K-fold
  cross-validation and iterated K-fold cross-validation with shuffling.
  Remember to always keep a completely separate test set for final model
  evaluation, since information leaks from your validation data to your model
  may have occurred.
* When you start working on a model, your goal is first to achieve a model that
  has some generalization power and that can overfit.
  Best practices to do this include
  tuning your learning rate and batch size, using better architecture
  priors, increasing model capacity, or simply training longer.
* As your model starts overfitting, your goal switches to improving
  generalization through *model regularization*. You can reduce your model’s
  capacity, add dropout or weight regularization, and use early stopping. And
  naturally, a larger or better dataset is always the number one way
  to help a model generalize.
